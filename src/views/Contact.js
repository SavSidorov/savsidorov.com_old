				I am a student at the University of British Columbia, studying engineering. In my high school years, I
				was involved in the FIRST Robotics Competition – a competitive robotics event for students. As founder
				and team captain of Team 5897 – APEX Robotics, I helped the team become one of the best performing teams
				in the Western Canada scene, attending the World Championship in its’ first year of existence.
				Currently, I am focusing on education while pursuing personal projects on the side.
